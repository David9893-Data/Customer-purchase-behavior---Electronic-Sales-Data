# Electronic Sales – September 2023 vs 2024 Comparative Analysis

## Why this project?

This project started with a simple intention: analyze overall sales performance. But very quickly, I realized that total revenue alone wasn’t telling the full story. To bring more clarity, I decided to focus on a precise comparison between September 2023 and September 2024, as it was the only common period in the dataset.

From that starting point, I deepened the analysis. Not just on what changed in numbers, but on how customer behavior, product performance, and operational choices might have influenced those changes.

## My Approach

Since 2023 data was only available from September to December, I chose to focus the comparison on September to ensure consistency. I then built an overview that covered monthly trends, product sales, payment and shipping preferences, and customer demographics.

The goal wasn’t just to highlight what worked, but also to understand why it worked and what could be done next.

## Key Insights

Sales in September 2024 increased by over 1,000% compared to the same month in 2023. This sharp growth suggests a major shift, possibly linked to a campaign, pricing strategy, or operational improvement.

Smartphones stood out as the top revenue driver, both in total sales and add-on revenue. This confirms a strong customer appetite and potential for cross-sell opportunities.

Sales were almost perfectly balanced between male and female customers, an encouraging signal in a typically male-dominated market segment.

Standard shipping was the most used, but same-day delivery showed strong traction, indicating that faster options may be increasingly important. Payment methods were well distributed, but there's still potential for optimization or diversification.

## Recommendations

Consolidate the momentum on smartphone sales through bundles or targeted offers to increase average basket size.

Investigate in detail what triggered the revenue spike in September 2024, to assess whether this trend is repeatable or linked to a specific event.

Strengthen fast shipping options such as same-day delivery, which could become a competitive advantage.

Encourage cross-sell strategies especially for categories with lower add-on revenue, such as headphones.

Enhance the dashboard by enabling multi-dimensional filtering, especially by product type, customer profile, and delivery mode, to uncover more granular insights.
